### Hello! I'm BjÃ¶rn ðŸ‘‹

- :briefcase: I currently work full-time as a Lead Web Engineer at [10up](https://10up.com/).
  - From a programming standpoint I focus mainly on back-end development in PHP and Hack, but also write JavaScript as needed.
  - I recently achieved a "Meta Platforms" specialty title after working closely with multiple teams at Meta (Facebook) building and maintaining websites with their custom and proprietary CMS. This included bringing multiple projects through the company's privacy review process and working with their i18n team to translate website content.
  - My main focus since around 2010 has been WordPress development such as custom theme development, plugin development, debugging, and maintenance.
  - I built and sell a WordPress plugin named [Cardinal Store Locator](https://cardinalwp.com/). This is what I usually work on when I have spare time.
  - I also built the open source [jQuery Store Locator plugin](https://github.com/bjorn2404/jQuery-Store-Locator-Plugin) and still occasionally release updates for it. At some point I'm hoping to rebuild the entire thing in React.
- :house: I currently live in the greater Seattle, WA area.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on developing my React skills.
- :mortar_board: I graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems from Iowa State University in Ames, IA.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him.
